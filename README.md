# The Clothing Store Project

## About the project:

This is a small fullstack app simulating the features modern webshops have as:

* **authentication**, where user can either create a new account and then later log in with it, or use an existing pre-created Dummy user.
* **filters**, which allows the user of the app to sort the items in the way he needs - by price or by category
* **favorites**, to save the items you liked into your cookie
* **cart**, to adjust the quantity/specification of the items you want to "buy" later on
* **profile**, a page where the user could either change the password or view the orders already made

## Techstack that was used:


* **React/Next.js**
* **Material UI**
* **Vanilla CSS**
* **Framer Motion**
* **MongoDB**
* **NextAuth, bcryptjs**
